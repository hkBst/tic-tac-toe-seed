# tic-tac-toe-seed
This is an extremely minimal [tic-tac-toe](https://github.com/hkBst/tic-tac-toe) webUI using [seed](https://github.com/seed-rs/seed), for comparison with other Rust front-end frameworks.

## how to use
Seed works fine with [trunk](https://github.com/thedodd/trunk), so install that: `cargo install trunk`.

Use `trunk serve` when developing and `trunk build --release` when deploying.
